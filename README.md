# Intelligent-Traffic-Light-Control-at-Intersections-Based-on-Real-Time-Data
DQN-Traffic-Light-Control.
In this project, the performance of a four-way intersection consisting of north, east, south, and west approaches was evaluated under two different control methods: a traditional system and a proposed artificial intelligence-based system. In the traditional approach, the phase sequence follows a clockwise order, and the green light duration for each direction is fixed at 30 seconds. This method lacks flexibility in adapting to real-time traffic variations, resulting in time loss and increased environmental pollution.
In contrast, the proposed method makes decisions based on real-time data, including the number of vehicles (final weight), waiting time, and the presence of emergency vehicles. Initially, a rule-based deterministic logic is used to select the eligible lane, and the corresponding lane data are then provided to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning algorithm to determine the optimal green light duration. This hybrid structure allows the system to combine the precision of rule-based logic with the adaptability and learning capability of artificial intelligence.
